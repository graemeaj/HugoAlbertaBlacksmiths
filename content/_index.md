The WCBG is committed to furthering the awareness and understanding of blacksmithing to the public.

The Western Canadian Blacksmiths’ Guild represents hobbyists and professional blacksmiths in Alberta.

The Edmonton region is represented by the “Founding Chapter”, which meets on the second Saturday of the month (February through December). Meetings are held at the Alberta Heritage Exposition Park located 6 km west of Leduc. (see map on next page). Usually around a dozen or so members show up at about 10:30 or 11 AM at the Blacksmith’s Shop. The shop represents a typical 1940’s era blacksmith’s shop.
