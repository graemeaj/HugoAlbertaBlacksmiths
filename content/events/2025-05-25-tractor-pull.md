The Western Canadian Blacksmithing Guild will be participating in LWAS’s 35th Anniversary event at the Alberta Heritage Exposition Park! This family-friendly event features a vintage tractor pull, BBQ competition, swap meet, historic displays, and more.

Our club will be hosting live blacksmithing demonstrations on Saturday and Sunday – a perfect chance to showcase your skills, inspire new enthusiasts, and connect with fellow members. We encourage all members to come out for the event.

For more information about the event, please see the [LWAS page](https://www.leducwestantique.com/country-swap-meet). See you there!
