The Guild is excited to host our first bloomery demonstration at the park! A bloomery is a small earth furnace where charcoal, fire and iron ore combine to create a "bloom" of iron metal. This ancient process produces real wrought iron, just as it was made before modern furnaces existed.

Join us to witness this fascinating piece of history in action and see how iron was crafted centuries ago. Donâ€™t miss this unique opportunity to experience the roots of blacksmithing!

Anyone who is interested in being part of the demo, please [contact us](/contact).

Also going on at the park is the largest LWAS event of the year, the LWAS Annual Exposition. The Expo will feature concessions, a vintage tractor pull competition, animal interaction, face painting, music events, vintage vehicle parade, demonstrations, historic buildings and displays.
