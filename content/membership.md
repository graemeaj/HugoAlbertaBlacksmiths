### WCBG Membership
The WCBG is always looking to increase our membership and get more people involved in blacksmithing. Membership is open to everyone.

### Benefits
Members have access to the anvils, forges, tools, scrap steel and coal at the Leduc shop on our meeting days. The guild is also comprised of many enthusiasts and professional smiths that are very happy to share their knowledge and skills with other members. 

Any member who brings only appropriate clothing and safety glasses can try blacksmithing at our shop. **[Learn more about what to bring to your first forging day.](/contact)** 

### Membership Expectations
Because of our symbiotic relationship with the heritage park we reside in, members are strongly encouraged to participate in the demonstrations during some of the events held by the Leduc West Antique Society. Participation in a minimum of one Leduc West Antique Society event per year is expected of every member. **[Click here to see upcoming events.](/events)** 

We also have a monthly video call meeting to discuss ongoing club activities and plans. Participation in these meetings is encouraged.

### Membership Application

The membership fee is $50.00 per year, which includes fees to cover the cost of coal and other shop supplies. Membership runs from January 1 to December 31.
